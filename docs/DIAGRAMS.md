# Logic diagrams

One diagram per flow, in `docs/*.mmd`. Indexed by the question each one
**answers** — open the one whose question you have. Conventions (node IDs are
real function names, dashed = failure/degraded, `%% covers:` headers) are in
CLAUDE.md's docs-toolkit block; `.\check-docs.ps1` flags a diagram when code
moves out from under it.

| Diagram | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| [request-flow.mmd](request-flow.mmd) | Which handler, slot, and generation path serves a given request? Why did my `tools` get ignored? How does a tool turn stream, and where is the call block held? |
| [slot-lifecycle.mmd](slot-lifecycle.mmd) | What happens between startup and "ready"? When does a slot get the CB backend vs the plain pipeline, how big is the KV pool, when does prewarm fire, and why doesn't a reload re-warm? |
| [stream-plumbing.mmd](stream-plumbing.mmd) | How do tokens travel from `pipe.generate` to the wire? Who owns cancel, why must the `finally: _cancel.set()` stay in the consumers, and what happens on a client disconnect or a silent backend? |
| [webui-render.mmd](webui-render.mmd) | How does the web UI render a streaming reply? Why does the think-block scroll survive redraws, what are the four think-tag states, and which layer stops model-output XSS? |
