# Next steps

Carried over after the optimum-backend merge (2026-08-13); everything else
from that branch's checklist shipped or is recorded in README/TODONT.

- Qwen3.5-4B vision verdict for the registry note (models.json).
- SmolLM3 registry notes could mention thinking-mode + `/no_think`.
- Nemotron Lightning: still blocked upstream (PR #1789 merged descoped — no
  `nemotron_h` exporter). Decide whether to file the optimum-intel feature
  request offering to test (the Glimmer issue #1927 pattern that worked).
- OpenVINO GPU-plugin bug for Glimmer-on-iGPU filed/tracked — re-run the
  TODONT comprehension test on each new OpenVINO release.
- When the B60 arrives (PostNord pickup ~2026-08-16): run the comprehension
  test FIRST (iGPUs across Xe-LPG/Xe2/Xe3 all fail — see TODONT; dGPU with
  dedicated VRAM is the untested memory path); post the verdict to
  openvino#37419 either way. Only if it passes, benchmark. Glimmer int4
  fits resident (17 GB in 24 GB) — expect 12-18 tok/s if correct.
- Glimmer in install.ps1/models.json: **deliberately absent** until BOTH
  gates close. (1) Stack gate — muse_glimmer in *released*
  transformers + optimum-intel, so the standard venv serves it with a
  requirements bump; an installer that builds a second venv from git
  main promises reproducibility it can't keep. (2) Device gate — a
  device where it's both correct and fast enough (B60 verdict Saturday,
  or an OpenVINO iGPU fix). Until then the README manual path
  (install-optimum.ps1) is the honest offering for the self-selecting
  few; CPU-only at 1.4-2.6 tok/s behind a menu item is a disappointment
  machine. Re-check the stack gate alongside the Nemotron watch. Any
  automation experiment lives on its own branch (the optimum-backend
  pattern: merge when verified, not before) — and don't cut that branch
  until at least one gate has closed, or it rots against install.ps1.
